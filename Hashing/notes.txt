Hashing:

Algorithm which helps searching in constant time.


Collision in hashing: If a hash function produces the same hash for different value it is Collision

for handling collision there are 2 types:

1. Closed Address - In the same address using linked list or tree
2. Open Address -
    a. Linear Probbing 
    b. Quadratic Probbing

Closed Address:
